Silent auction bid tracker. 
==========

This is a small django project that I built to help out my son's school with their annual charity silent-auction.
It is basically a list of items and bidders. At the end of the night, the auction staff can take the bid sheets
and quickly associate each item with the highest bidder. The app will then show a list of the items won for a given
bidder, allowing for a quick checkout process and sending a receipt email at the end of the night.
